Aztec (extend EditText) is a rich text editor component for writing HTML
documents in Android.

Support Android 4.0+

# Build and test

Build the library, build the example project and run unit tests:

```shell
$ ./gradlew build
```

Run unit tests only:

```shell
$ ./gradlew test
```

Note: there is no instrumentation tests at the moment.

# Integrate in your project

The library is not ready for prime time yet, so it's not distributed on maven
central. Brave developers can either use the project as a source distribution
or have fun with jitpack at their own risk:

```gradle
compile ('com.github.wordpress-mobile.WordPress-Aztec-Android:aztec:develop-SNAPSHOT')
```

When Aztec is ready, we'll publish the artifact in maven.
